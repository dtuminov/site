          <div>Herodotos described the SCYTHIANS, inhabiting the "lands East and North of the Danube river". "Scythian" is the collective name of a group of TURANIAN people, supposedly descendants of the SUMERIANS, but certainly carriers and preservers of the Sumerian culture. To the family of Scythian nations belonged the "Dacs" of ancient Dacians, the Huns, the Avars, the Bulgarians and the Magyars or Hungarians.</div>

          <div>By compiling all available data, Greek historians gave the first account of the migration of the Magyars (Hungarians) into the Carpathian Basin. According to this account, the Hungarians followed the trail of their brother-nations, the Huns and the Avars, moving first from the Volga-region into Etelkoz, then expanding slowly in a Westerly and south-westerly direction as far as today's Moldova, and finally crossing the Carpathians through three different routes, while a forth unit, in alliance with the
        Byzantine forces, attacked the Bulgarians at the lower Danube, took possession of the fertile lands between the Danube river and the Southern Carpathians or Transylvanian Alps, and joined the rest of the nation at the Iron Gate: a gorge cut by the Danube through thc mountains, south of the Great Hungarian Plain.</div>

Bonn.) mentioned for the first time the name VLACH, describing a people of primitive herdsmen located between Kastoria and Prespa, near today"s Albanian border, who centuries later became the ancestors of the Rumanians.

          <div>Vatican missionaries establish a church in the fort of "Varad" later called "Nagy-Varad" today Oradea. Reports sent back to Rome by the same missionaries described the small tribe of the JAZIG" who spoke "almost the same language" as the Hungarians, and was supposed to be living in the same region long before the Hungarians arrived. The descendants of the Jazig, called today "Jasz", can still be found on the Great Hungarian Plain, west of Nagyvarad. They are the only recorded inhabitants found by the Hungarian settlers in the Carpathian Basin, including Transylvania, except a few scattered fragments of SLAVS, who became assimilated within a few decades, and completely disappeared, leaving behind nothing more than a very few and widely scattered geographical names.</div>

          <div>Byzantine traders reported "rich Hungarian towns" in Transylvania where "good wine, raw gold, hides and various carved tools and art objects" could be purchased in exchange for silk and jewelry. They described the inhabitants as "proud Christians" and the country as "lively towns, cultivated valleys, surrounded by uninhabited mountain ranges and dense forests." Since the wife of chief Gyula, residing in Gyulafehervar was a Byzantine Princess, there was a lively exchange between the Eastern part of Hungary, called ERDOELVE (Transylvania) and the Byzantine empire. Thus, Christianity entered the Carpathian Basin in the same time from the West and from the East.</div>

These Vlach immigrants, who received asylum within the Hungarian Kingdom, and others who followed later, became the ancestors of the Transylvanian Rumanians. Officially they were called VLACHS, from which the Hungarian name OLAH and the German name Wallach derived, in contradistinction to the Rumelians and later Rumanians who did not enter the Western culture-circle but stayed East and South of the Carpathians under Byzantine and later Slavic influence" finally evolving at the end of the nineteenth century into Rumania.</div>

Only the Eastern part, including Transylvania carried on the traditions of an independent Hungary "under freely elected Dukes" until 1690. Many historians refer to this era as the
        
        "Independent Transylvania", forgetting that in reality Transylvania was the only free part left of Hungary, a last fortress between the Habsburgs and the Turks, where the elected Dukes, exercising the office of the king, kept the peace by wisely balancing their diplomatic relations with both sides, according to the demands of necessity.</div>

Radu was ordered out of the country. Nevertheless, some of his people were allowed to remain, and build new Vlach (Rumanian) villages in the central region of Transylvania.</div>

          <div>Emperor Luitpold Habsburg of Austria conquered Transylvania, abolished the Hungarian constitution, and turned the country into a province of Austria. The persecution of the Protestants began anew. Clergymen and schoolteachers were killed or tortured and sent to the galleys in the Mediterranian, where they died as slaves. With this, the last stronghold of the constitutional Hungarian Kingdom, Transylvania, fell into the clutches of Habsburg absolutism. All constitutional rights of the established nationalities as well as the established Protestant churches were revoked.

Emperor Charles III refused the demand on the grounds that "the Crown recognizes only subjects of different tongues and different religious denominations, not nationalities." Bishop Micu Klein was the first to use the word "RUMUN" instead of Vlach, and to claim LATIN origin. Until then the popular concept accepted the Slavic origin of the Vlachs, based on the use of the Slavic language in the Greek Orthodox Church as well as on
        the fact, established by several linguists (including Prof. Cihac, Rumanian linguist of the XX century) that 48% of the Rumanian language consisted of Slavic words and only 31% of the Latin.</div>

In spite of this, the Transylvanian Vlachs again launched a well organized attack against Hungarian towns and villages, in support of the Habsburg forces. "These Wallachians committed such dreadful crimes against the elderly, women and children" wrote Mme.

More than one hundred Hungarian demonstrators were killed, and more than a thousand wounded. In punishment for the demonstration Rumanian troops looted and ransacked the city.
        
        Peter Pastor writes in "The Vix Mission in Hungary, 19181919, a Re-examination" (Slavic Review XXIX, No. 3 1970) and in "Franco-Rumanian Intervention in Russia and the Vix Ultimatum: Background to Hungary's Loss of Transylvania" (1974):
        
        "The Vix Ultimatum, delivered to the Hungarians on March 20, 1919 by the head of the French Military Mission in Hungary, Lt. Colonel Ferdinand Vix, seemed to legitimize Rumanian occupation of Transylvania. The opening of the archives of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs for 1918 and 1919 in the summer of 1972 shed new and startling light on the affair.... It is now evident that the ultimatum was prompted by a sudden crisis in southern Russia where Allied troops under French command were being defeated by the Red Army. To obtain quick reinforcements from neighbouring Rumania" the French Premier and Minister of War G. Clemenceau had to pay off the Rumanians at once with the Transylvanian territory they coveted ..."
        
        The documents of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs make it quite clear now that Transylvania, as well as part of the Banat and part of the Great Hungarian Plain were given to Rumania by the French alone, in four separate chunks, with complete disregard of the Wilsonian doctrine of self determination, and without the knowledge and approval of the Governments of the United States and Great Britain in order to buy Rumanian support against Russia.
        
        Already on January 27, 1919, the Peace Conference in Paris had adopted President Wilson's resolution against the use of armed force "to gain possession of territory, the rightful claim to which the Peace Conference is to be asked to determine." (Spector:
        
        Rumania at the Paris Peace Conference, page -80-. (Pastor writes in "Franco-Rumanian Intervention in Russia and the Vix Ultimatum: Background to Hungary's Loss of Transylvania", page 17: The Supreme Council referred Rumania's territorial claims to a "Commission for the Study of Territorial Questions Relating to Rumania." The eight-member panel of French, British, Italian and American experts was to examine Rumania"s claims on its four neighbors - Russia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Hungary. But the Rumanians disregarded both: Wilson's call for peace and the new commission. They continued to advance into Hungarian territory."
        
        Thus, long before any desicions were made by the Peace Conference in regard of Rumania's territorial claim in Transylvania, Rumania with French encouragement took possession of Transylvania, the Banat and part of the Great Hungarian Plain. Occupying lands with not one Rumanian inhabitant, whatsoever. Thereby deceiving the Governments of the United States, Great Britain and Italy, motivated by its own greed and by French desire to gain Rumanian military aid against Russia.</div>

          <div>1920</div>
          <div>By March 1920 all markers, street-signs, village-signs, railroad-signs etc. were torn down in the entire Rumanian-occupied territory and replaced by new signs in Rumanian language. Rumanian names were created for towns and villages with no Rumanian inhabitants. When the International Peace Commission came to inspect the new border-line proposed by France and Rumania, they were given the impression that not one single Hungarian inhabited the land.
        
        On June 4, the Hungarian Government was compelled to sign the TREATY of TRIANON, by which the thousand year old Hungary was shorn of almost three-fourths of its territory, and two-thirds of its inhabitants .
        
        However, on the insistence of the Allied Powers article 47 was included in the treaty, stipulating that Rumania pledges itself to protect the interest of those citizens who differ from the majority of the population in respect of race, language or religion.
        
        However, by then more than 150,000 Hungarians mostly civil servants and teachers, were expelled from their native country and the "forced Rumanization of Transylvania began." (See: E. Osterhaven "Transylvania ..." page 19.). As a result of the Trianon Dictum from the 20,886,487 popu1ation of Hungary -13-,271,370 were placed under the domination of other countries.

        Parallel with the economic persecution, the Rumanian government undertook an all-out offensive against Hungarian schooling. Hungarian, as a language of instruction, was abolished and its use strictly forbidden in al1 public schools. In many cases children were cruelly beaten for using their native tongue, even among themselves during the recess.</div>

The laws of 1925 serve as oppressive political and nationalistic tools against the minorities." (Religious Minorities in Transylvania, The Bacon Press, Boston, 1925.) While in 1911, under Hungarian rule, there were 2,813 public schools in Transylvania in which Rumanian was the language of instruction, by 1925, five years after the Rumanian take-over, there was none left at all for the use of the Hungarian language. Transylvania’s biggest Hungarian-language daily newspaper, the BRASSOI LAPOK, reported on December 14, 1925 from Csikjenofalva, a 100% Hungarian community: "The new teacher, Mr. Clements Tratiu, who was sent recently by the government to teach in the purely Hungarian village of Csikjenofalva, in his efforts to enforce the new language regulations handed out such beatings to his pupils that on the first day parents had to carry home twenty-four badly beaten children from the schoolhoose who were unable to walk."</div>

        According to eyewitness reports, from the city of Kolozsvar alone more than -24-,000 Hungarians were herded together, beaten, tortured and deported. Within three months an estimated 200,000 Hungarians were moved out in this way from Transylvania, and placed into labor camps, mostly in the swamps of Dobrudja.
        
        Some of the sworn testimonies of surviving eyewitnesses can be found in the APPENDIX.</div>

        <div class="container1">
          <div>1945</div>
          <div>The Soviet Military Administration of Northern Transylvania was replaced by Rumanian administration. Mr. Zathureczky writes in his book "Transylvania, Citadel of the West" (Danubian Press, 1964) page 52: "Stalin gave back Northern Transylvania to the Rumanians under the condition that they would respect the rights of the ethnic groups. With this step he introduced into Transylvania the Stalinist national policy. This policy consisted of the recognition of ethnic autonomies" and it was based on a federation of these autonomies. These autonomies are nationalistic in form, and socialistic in substance."
        
        One of the conditions, under which the Russian Military Government returned the full administration of Transylvania to the Rumanians was the setting up of two or more Autonomous Hungarian Districts in order to secure complete self-administration to the Hungarian population of Transylvania.
        
        This condition as well as many others pertaining to the basic rights of the Hungarians in Transylvania were never fulfilled by the Rumanian government.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container1">
          <div>1947</div>
          <div>On February 10 the Rumanian Peace Treaty was signed in Paris, of ficially declaring the return of Northern Transylvania to Rumania - in spite of American protest. Rumania again guaranteed the rights of the minorities .
        
        On April 13 the Rumanian People"s Republic was proclaimed.
        
        On August 7 a new constitution was adopted, which again proclaimed equal rights and self administration to the national minorities. However, all religious and cultural organizations were subjected to State control. Roman Catholic opposition led to the arrest of the remaining bishops and to dissolution of all Roman Catholic organizations.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container1">
          <div>1949</div>
          <div>Lay leaders, priests, ministers of the Roman Catholic, Calvinist, Lutheran and Unitarian churches were imprisoned or sent to forced labor camps.
        
        The Greek Catholic Church was liquidated by law. The congregations of these parishes were automatically "returned into the Greek Orthodox Church and listed on census-sheets as "Rumanians" no matter which ethnic group they belonged.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container1">
          <div>1950</div>
          <div>Under Soviet pressure the Rumanian government agreed to create an Autonomous Hungarian Region on the Territory inhabited by a compact Hungarian (Szekely) population with the capital of Marosvasarhely Tirgu Mures. In this "autonomous" region, however, the official language remained the Rumanian, the top administrative offices were held by Rumanians, sent there directly from Bucharest, and the police force was kept 100% Rumanian. Those Hungarians who dared to object, were deported into the i1l-famed labor camps in the Danube delta.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container1">
          <div>1956</div>
          <div>Following the uprising in Hungary, the Rumanian Government availed itself of the opportunity to order new mass-arrests throughout Transylvania. Though only seventeen Hungarians were executed - beside Imre Nagy, premier of Hungary for those few glorious days of freedom and his entourage who were handed over by the Russians for "safekeeping" - more than 200 died from the beatings during the interrogation, and about six thousand received heavy prison sentences in Kolozsvar alone. For eyewitness testimonies see APPENDIX. George Bailey, American journalist, described the situation in THE REPORTER of November 1964: "After the Hungarian revolution thousands of Hungarians were arrested in Transylvania, perhaps hundreds put to death. In one trial alone in Cluj thirteen out of fiftyseven accused were executed. This year (1964) some eight thousand political prisoners were released with considerable fanfare by the Government in a general amnesty."
        
        M. Eugene Osterhaven in The Present Situation of Hungarians in Transylvania, Western Theological Seminary, Holland, Michigan, 1968, page 34, adds to this: " . . .
        
        but as far as I could ascertain (in 1968) in my recent travels through Transylvania, not one of the Hungarians arrested during the revolt has yet been released."</div>

        <div class="container1">
          <div>1959</div>
          <div>The Hungarian University of Kolozsvar and the Hungarian high schoo1s all over Transylvania became absorbed by their Rumanian counterparts. Thus Hungarian higher education was abolished in Transylvania. Several members of the Hungarian faculty were driven to suicide. (See: "Der Spiegel" No. 45, October -31-. 1966. Also: "National Minority Problems" by George Hay in Kurt, London, ed. of Eastern Europe in Transition, The John Hopkins Press, Baltimore, 1966, page -133-. Also: The New York Times, June 10. 1959.(
        
        The Hungarian Institute of Medicine and Pharmacy, located in Marosvasarhely (Tirgu Mures) lost its autonomy. (See: Robert R. King "Minorities Under Communism", Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1973, pages 153-154.(</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container1">
          <div>1960</div>
          <div>The Rumanian Government removed two districts from the Autonomous Hungarian Province, both with 92% Hungarian population, and attached them to a Rumanian populated district, while adding to it in exchange another large area with 88% Rumanian population, thus trying to weaken the Hungarian majority of the Hungarian province. The name was also changed from "Autonom Hungarian Province" to "Autonom Hungarian-Mures Territory."</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container1">
          <div>1963</div>
          <div>Edward Crankshaw reported in his article "Hungarian Minority Fears Rumanian Axe" (The New York Herald Tribune, Apr. 15, 1963.) that Hungarian fami1ies are being deported in mass from purely Hungarian districts of Transylvania into other parts of Rumania, mostly to the Danube delta, into huge labor camps, where they die by the hundreds due to lack of food and medical care.
        
        It is being noted also, that those deported or "re-settled" under the pretense of job opportunities - already more than 200,000 people - are immediately stricken from the official records in Transylvania, while in their new locations they are listed by the census takers as Rumanians. The Rumanization of Transylvania was so successful, that in September 1963, when Mr. Georghiu-Dej, party-boss and prime minister visited the so-called "Autonomous Hungarian Territory" and the Rumanian newspapers reported the names of the officials of the territory - there was not one single Hungarian name among them!</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container1">
          <div>1964</div>
          <div>The International Commission of Jurists examined the Transylvanian minority problem, and pub1ished a report entit1ed "The Hungarian Minority Prob1em in Rumania". In this report the Commission stated among others that "Rumania ignores the political clauses of the Peace Treaty, and its own constitution, Art. 82, which clearly provides that "all national groups are entitled to use their respective languages and to have at all levels establishments of public education in which instruction is given in their mother tongue, and further that the spoken and written language used by administrative and judicial authorities in districts where a national group other than Rumanian is in the majority should be the language of this national group. Civil
        
        servants in such areas should be appointed from among the members of this majority group ..." This commission found that Rumanian administrative measures, and discrimination in the cultural field" is actually leading to the final genocide of minonties in Transylvania."
        
        On July 4, the same year, the LE MONDE in Paris, France reported of a new wave of deportations from the Hungarian districts in Transylvania to the Danube delta. The same paper estimated the number of Hungarians forced to live in Bucharest alone to 250,000, a figure not included in the official data of any census.
        
        On August 8: "Due to the de-Magyarization policy of the Rumanian government of forcib1y removing Hungarian families from their native districts and deporting them or forcing them to locate in Moldavia, Dobrudja, even Bucharest or any one of the former Vlach provinces, it seems that 35 to 50 percent of the Transy1vanian Hungarians are no longer 1iving in their native land. The vacated houses of the deported or removed Hungarian families are filled with Rumanian families imported from across the Carpathians in order to change the ethnic balance of the purely Hungarian districts. According to Government orders wherever there are two pupils in a Hungarian language school who do not speak that language, the language of the entire school must be changed into Rumanian. Thus, with the settling of these newcomers, all Hungarian language grade-, middle-, and high-schools are being abolished, one by one ..." (CONGRESSIONAL RECORDS, August 8, 1964.)
        
        On November 1964 George Bailey wrote in THE REPORTER: "Rumania has effectively replaced Hungarian at every level as the language of official and public life ... Hungarians are intimidated, they are scared to use their native tongue. The Rumanian authorities have adopted a wide variety of measures to isolate the Hungarian population from contact with the homeland. Foreign tourists in Rumania are allowed the run of the country, unless they happen to be Hungarian citizens . . ."
        
        Robert R. King wrote in "Minorities Under Communism" (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1973) pages 156-157: "The 1964 redistricting of the Magyar Autonomous Region into Mures-Magyar Region increased the Rumanian population of the district from 146,830 (20%) to a 266,403 (35%) while decreasing the number of Hungarians from 565,510 (77%) to 473,154 (62)."</div>

          <div>CARE Packages and other aids sent by American, Canadian, Australian or West European church organizations, charitable institutions or private individuals to starving Hungarian families in Transylvania, or to Transylvanian Hungarian Churches were confiscated by Rumanian authorities.

          <div>1967</div>
          <div>On October 12 the Mures-Magyar Autonomous Region became liquidated. The previous 16 regions were rearranged into 40 districts and 2,706 communes. The aim was to mix as many Rumanian inhabited regions with Hungarian regions as geographically possible, thus lowering the percentage rate of Hungarians within the administrative units. "The chauvin
        
        and international obligations solemnly agreed upon and promised in peace treaties ..." (Osterhaven: Transylvania, page 40)
        
        On December 3, 1967, the NEUE ZURICHER ZEITUNG, Switzerland, reported that in the "Hungarian populated areas of Transylvania the presence of the secret police is still strong. Political opponents (of Mr. Ceaucescu) and troublesome intellectuals are put behind bars without delay ..."</div>

          <div>The "Handbuch Europaischer Volksgruppen" (Reference Book on European Ethnic Groups) estimated the Hungarian population of Transylvania as two millions.
        
        On November 2, 1974, Act 63 of the Socialist Republic of Rumania amended Law -472-/1971, ordering the "nationalization of all documents, books, letters, pictures, art objects, etc. in possession of religious and cultural institutions or private citizens."
        
        This amendment of the law was another decisive step toward the complete Rumanization of Transylvania by eliminating all traces of a Hungarian past, and thus clearing the way for a new, fa1sified history, already in the making.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container1">
          <div>1975</div>
          <div>On February 1, the NEUE ZURICHER ZEITUNG, Switzerland, reported under the tit1e "Bureaucratic Chicanery Against the Churches in Rumania" that "The intent behind the nationalization of the ecclesiastical archives is to sever the religious communities from their historical roots. A church without a past (tradition) has no future, especially one which represents a religious and national minority in the same time ... the Rumanian government has openly embarked on an escalated campaign against the Church and the Hungarian minority. " "The above mentioned outrages form a part of a systematic effort to re-write Rumanian history ..." (Human Rights Vio1ations against the Hungarian Minority in Rumania, a Committee for Human Rights publication, 1976.)
        
        In the same time THE FINANCIAL TIMES reported: "A favourite device is to "facelift" the tombs and crypts of famous Hungarian families in the Medieval Hazsongard cemetery in Cluj (Kolozsvar) by allotting them to recently dead Rumanians. In this way the ethnic composition of the former population, now dead, is restructured favourab1y ..."
        
        Also The Finaficial Times reported on Apr. 2. 1975 under the title "Transylvania"s Ethnic Strains" that at least 25 students are required to set up a minority class in any school, while a Rumanian class has to be set up as soon as there are two Rumanian speaking students. This report refers to Law -278-/1973 which ca11s for the merger of classes with insufficient numbers of students, and provides that every community with Rumanian speaking students, no matter how few, must establish a Rumanian section. Since most rural villages in Transylvania have only 500 to 1000 inhabitants, there may very possibly not be enough Hungarian students for a separate class (25). As a result of this law the merger necessarily occurs at the expense of the Hungarian section, even if the population of that village is 90% Hungarian.
        
        Protests concerning the oppression of and the gross discrimination against the Hungarian minority in Rumania reached the United Nations Division of Human Rights Office to be submitted to the Commission on Human Rights and to the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, in Geneva.
        
        Thirty-eight members of the U.S. Congress condemned the treatment of the Hungarian Minority by the Rumanian Government, and asked President Ford to discuss with President Ceaucescu "the abridgement of human and civil rights of the ethnic and religious minorities in Rumania." (SEE: Congressional Records, May and June 1975. Also: "Documents on the Human Rights Violations Against the Hungarian Minority in Rumania Before the United Nations Human Rights Commission, The World Council of Churches and the United States Congress and Government" published by the American Hungarian Federation, Washington, D.C. 1975)
        
        G. Satmarescu, Rumanian author and scholar, repudiated the published figures of the recent Rumanian census by estimating the total number of Hungarians in Rumania at 2.5 million. (East Central Europe, edited by Stephen Fischer-Galati, University of Colorado, 1975.)</div>

          <div>In June 1976 a joint Memorandum of the American Hungarian Federation and the Transylvanian World Federation was presented to the United States Congress, asking for the withdrawal of the "Preferred Nation" status granted to Rumania previously, until that government fulfilled its obligations toward the minorities as outlined in the peace treaties as well as in the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Rumania. (SEE: CONGRESSIONAL RECORDS, June, 1976.)
        
        In July 1976, protests against the blatant oppression of minority Churches and ethnic groups in Rumania were entered to the United Nations and the World Council of Churches Assembly in Nairobi, Africa, by Bishop Dr. Zoltan Beky, representing the Transylvanian World Federation and the American Hungarian Federation.
        
        The Committee for Human Rights in Rumania in New York demonstrated repeatedly against the Rumanian Government and demanded the investigation of minority grievances in Rumania.
        
        In October 1976 the United States Government asked the Government of the Socialist Republic of Rumania to grant permission" in accordance with the Helsinki Agreement, to a special investigating committee to enter Rumania and investigate the alleged human rights violations and discriminations against the minorities. The Rumanian government refused to grant the permission.</div>
